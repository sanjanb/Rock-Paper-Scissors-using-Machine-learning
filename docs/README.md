# Rock-Paper-Scissors (RPS) Machine Learning Project

This project focuses on using machine learning and pattern recognition techniques to improve the winning rate in the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors (RPS) game. Our `player` function adapts to different opponents by analyzing their patterns and countering their moves, aiming to achieve a higher winning percentage through strategic play.

## Project Description

The Rock-Paper-Scissors Machine Learning Project is designed to test different strategies against opponents with predefined patterns. By analyzing opponents' moves, the `player` function adjusts its tactics, leveraging concepts like frequency analysis and pattern recognition to counter moves effectively. This project demonstrates how machine learning principles can be applied to develop smarter, adaptive algorithms even in simple games like RPS.

## Features

- **Adaptive Strategy**: The `player` function adjusts based on the opponent's historical plays.
- **Pattern Recognition**: Detects and counters opponents with fixed patterns.
- **Frequency Analysis**: Identifies and counters the most common moves of each opponent.

## Installation Steps

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/RPS_Game.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd RPS_Game
   ```
3. **Install dependencies** (if any). This project requires Python 3.x, but no external libraries are needed.

## How to Play the Game

The game can be run in simulation mode to test the `player` function against various bots or interactively against a bot.

1. **Run Simulations Against Bots**:
   You can test your `player` function against different bot strategies to see how it performs.

   ```bash
   python src/main.py
   ```

   The script will run multiple games against each bot (e.g., `quincy`, `abbey`, etc.) and display the winning percentage for each.

2. **Play Interactively**:
   Uncomment the line in `main.py` to play against a bot interactively. For example:

   ```python
   # Uncomment this line in main.py
   # play(human, abbey, 20, verbose=True)
   ```

   Then run the script and input your moves to play against the bot.

3. **Run Tests**:
   Use the included unit tests to verify that the `player` function achieves a target winning percentage against each bot. Run tests using:
   ```bash
   python -m unittest discover tests
   ```
