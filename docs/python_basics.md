# Python Programming Basics

This document provides an introduction to the Python programming basics relevant to the RPS project.

## Data Structures

### Lists

Lists are ordered, mutable collections in Python. In this project, lists store:

- Opponents' move histories to analyze patterns and frequencies.
  Example:

```python
opponent_history = ["R", "P", "S"]
```
````

### Dictionaries

Dictionaries store key-value pairs and are used here to track:

- Counts of two-move sequences.
- Frequency of each move in opponents' histories.

Example:

```python
play_order = {
    "RR": 0, "RP": 0, "RS": 0,
    "PR": 0, "PP": 0, "PS": 0,
    "SR": 0, "SP": 0, "SS": 0
}
```

## Functions and Control Flow

### Functions

Functions encapsulate reusable code. The `player` function in `RPS.py` is an example of a function that predicts the next move based on past data.

### Control Flow

Control flow statements, such as `if`, `for`, and `while`, direct the execution of code. In the player function:

- `if` statements choose strategies based on conditions.
- `for` loops help analyze historical data.

## Basics of Unit Testing

Unit tests validate the functionality of code by checking expected outputs. In this project, `test_module.py` uses `unittest` to test that the player achieves a specified win rate against different opponents.

Example:

```python
import unittest
from RPS_game import play, quincy
from RPS import player

class UnitTests(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_player_vs_quincy(self):
        result = play(player, quincy, 1000)
        self.assertTrue(result >= 60, "Expected player to win 60% of the time")
```

Unit tests ensure code reliability and help catch errors early.
